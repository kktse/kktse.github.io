Welcome. I am a full-stack software developer with a passion for systems
engineering. I create clarity into engineering problems that enables teams to
deliver value fast. My advocacy for _continuous improvement_ is the
foundation of my ability to deliver simple and effective solutions in the
face of complexity and ambiguity. I currently work at [Wave
Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/).

My journey in vehicle dynamics continues. I am a collaborator at [Formula
Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) where I apply vehicle dynamics theory to help
drivers be safe, go fast and have fun. Motorsports is a platform for me to
test my abilities in systems engineering, project management and decision
making.
