Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I am currently seeking new
opportunities in the technology or automotive sector. I am a former vehicle
dynamics professional.

I write about my studies in vehicle dynamics. I combine my expertise in
software development to explore and recontextualize foundational concepts in
vehicle dynamics. I am interested in how simple vehicle dynamic models can
improve performance outcomes in competitive motorsport. My current focus is at
the club level where tire and vehicle parameterization data is difficult to
obtain.

My mission is to make technical analysis in vehicle dynamics commonplace. My
vision is to grow the knowledge base in the automotive community to hold
automakers, aftermarket producers and service providers to a higher standard of
performance and safety.

I am a collaborator with the [Formula Delta][instagram] time attack project.
