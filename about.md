Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I currently work as a
_Technical Product Manager_ at Properly.

This site is focused on my vehicle dynamics practice and study. I am interested
in how vehicle dynamics theory can improve performance outcomes at the club
level where access to data is constrained. My mission is to apply vehicle
dynamics concepts in the simplest way possible to help drivers be safe, realize
their potential and to improve their enjoyment of the sport. My vision is to
make a more accessible, competitive and inclusive sport by raising the
knowledge floor of the community. I am collaborator with the [Formula
Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) time attack project.

I am open to short-term opportunities in vehicle dynamics. Interested in
working together?
