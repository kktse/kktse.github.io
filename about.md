Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I am currently seeking new
opportunities in the technology or automotive sector. I am a former vehicle
dynamics professional.

I write about my studies in vehicle dynamics. I am interested in how simple
vehicle dynamic models can improve performance outcomes in competitive
motorsport. My current focus is at the club level where tire and vehicle
parameterization data is difficult to obtain.

My mission is to make technical analysis in vehicle dynamics commonplace. My
vision is to grow the knowledge base in the automotive community to hold
automakers, aftermarket producers and service providers to a higher standard of
performance and safety.

I am a collaborator with the [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) time
attack project.
