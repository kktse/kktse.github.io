Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I am currently seeking new
opportunities in the technology or automotive sector. I am a former vehicle
dynamics professional.

This site is focused on my vehicle dynamics practice and study. I am interested
in how vehicle dynamics concepts can improve driver outcomes in motorsport.
This is often realized with the help modern scientific computing frameworks. My
current focus is at the club level where access to tire and vehicle
parameterization data is limited.

My mission is to make technical analysis in vehicle dynamics commonplace. My
vision is to grow the automotive community to hold manufacturers, aftermarket
producers and service providers to a higher standard of performance and safety.

I am a collaborator with the [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) time
attack project.

**For recruiters and job opportunities**, please message me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ktse/). I do not accept invitations from
those whom I have not had prior work experience with or invitations without
specific inquiry. I am open to short-term opportunities in vehicle dynamics.
