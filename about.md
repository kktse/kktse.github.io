Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I am currently seeking new
opportunities in the technology or automotive sector. I am a former vehicle
dynamics professional.

This site is focused on my vehicle dynamics practice and study. I am interested
in how vehicle dynamics theory can improve driver outcomes in motorsport. This
is realized through technology and with the help modern scientific computing
frameworks. My current focus is at the club level where access to tire and
vehicle parameterization is limited.

My mission is to make technical analysis in vehicle dynamics commonplace. My
vision is to grow the automotive community to hold manufacturers, aftermarket
producers and service providers to a higher standard of performance and safety.

I am a collaborator with the [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) time
attack project.

I am open to short-term opportunities in vehicle dynamics. Interested in
working together?
