I am a full-stack software developer based in the Toronto area. I help create
clarity into your toughest engineering problems. I bring the best of what
lean production and software engineering has to offer to focus on what is
important. Past career in the automotive sector specializing in vehicle
dynamics. I currently work at [Wave Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/).

I am a collaborator at [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca), a time
attack project started by my colleagues. I apply vehicle dynamics theory to
help the community be safer, go faster and ultimately have more fun.
