Welcome. I am a full-stack software developer and currently work at [Wave
Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/) as an _Engineering Lead_.

I continue to practice vehicle dynamics as an amateur. Grassroots motorsports is
a platform I use to test my abilities in systems engineering and vehicle
dynamics. My goal is to apply vehicle dynamics theory in the simplest way to
demonstrate its applicability to modern road vehicles.

I am a collaborator at [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca), a time attack
project based in the Greater Toronto Area.
