Welcome. I am a professional software developer. I currently work as a _Senior
Software Developer_ at Properly.

This site is focused on my non-professional vehicle dynamics practice and
study. I am interested in how vehicle dynamics theory can improve performance
outcomes at the club level. My mission is to apply vehicle dynamics concepts in
the simplest way possible to help drivers be safe, realize their potential and
to improve their enjoyment of the sport. My vision is to make a more
accessible, competitive and inclusive sport by raising the knowledge floor of
the community.

I am collaborator with the [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca) time attack
project.

Interested in working together?
