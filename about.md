The dynamics of the modern road car are the result of years of automotive
engineering and advancement. I study vehicle dynamics to appreciate this
evolution.

I am a full-stack software developer based in the Toronto area. I use my
background in engineering and technology bring clarity to your toughest
problems. I currently work at [Wave Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/).

I am a collaborator with [Formula Delta](https://formuladelta.ca), a time
attack project started by my friends. I apply vehicle dynamics theory to help
the community be safer, go faster and ultimately have more fun.
