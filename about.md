Welcome! I'm Kelvin. I am a software developer in the Greater Toronto Area. I
combine engineering with technology to solve your most difficult problems. I
obtained my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the
University of Waterloo, focusing on controls and dynamics. My career has
taken me across the automotive sector in manufacturing, automation, and R&D
roles. I currently work at [Wave Financial](https://www.waveapps.com/) as a
full-stack developer.

In my spare time, I study _vehicle dynamics_; the study of road vehicles in
motion. I combine numerical simulation with practical experimentation to
examine concepts in vehicle dynamics. You'll often find me at the local race
track with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FormulaDeltaConsult"><svg
