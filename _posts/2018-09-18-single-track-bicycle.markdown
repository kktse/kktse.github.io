## Introduction

Early mathematical models describing the lateral dynamics of an automobile
represented major advancements in vehicle dynamics. Among the automotive
pioneers was the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratories (CAL), who sought a
quantitative way of characterising directional control and stability. Using
their expertise in studying aircraft dynamics, their research resulted in a set
of equations that described lateral dynamics of a car.

In 1956, the findings at CAL were published in the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers (IME). Two vehicle models were presented: a three-degree-of-freedom
model presented by Leonard Segel, and a simplified two-degree-of-freedom model
\- also known as the bicycle model - presented by David Whitecomb and William
Milliken.

Of the two models, the simpler two-degree-of-freedom model remains a
cornerstone of vehicle dynamics. Its usefulness lies in its simplicity, both
conceptually and computationally. The importance of this model is not to be
understated; it is the first vehicle model presented in vehicle dynamics
curriculum and serves as a foundational vehicle model in research literature.

As a tribute to this historic work, we present the equations-of-motion
describing the lateral dynamics of a linear single-track vehicle.

### Approach
The derivation is based on a force and moment balance with inertial reactions
of a single-track vehicle. The formulae is derived symbolically using the
Python package _Sympy_ v1.1.1.

Vehicle Dynamics_ by W.F. Milliken & D.L. Milliken.

## Base Assumptions
### Force and Moment Balance
The force and moment balance of a single-track bicycle is described by the
following free-body diagram:

![Bicycle Free-body Diagram]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/2018-09-18/bicycle_model.png)

&nbsp;


Based on the free-body diagram, the equations describing the force and moment
balance are governed by the following equations:

$$ m(\dot{v} + u \cdot r) = F_{y,f} \cos{\left(\delta\right)} + F_{y,r} $$

$$ I \dot{r} = a F_{y,f} \cos{\left(\delta\right)} - b F_{y,r} $$

To simplify the derivation, we assume small angle variations in the steered
angle, $$\delta$$. By this assumption, we linearize the $$\cos{\left(\delta\right)}$$ about
an operating region around $$\delta = 0$$ such that $$\cos{\left(\delta\right)} \simeq 1$$.
Therefore, the force and moment balance equations become:

$$ m(\dot{v} + u \cdot r) = F_{y,f} + F_{y,r} $$

$$ I \dot{r} = a F_{y,f} - b F_{y,r} $$

### Tire Model
The lateral force generated by the tires is assumed to be a linear function of
the slip angle.

$$ F_{y,f} = -C_f \alpha_f $$

$$ F_{y,r} = -C_r \alpha_r $$

The linear stiffness assumption is only valid for small slip angles. Generally
speaking, the validity of this assumption restricts analysis to maneuvers low
lateral accelerations.

Note: the cornering stiffness $$C_f$$ and $$C_r$$ represents the effective
cornering stiffness of the axle.

### Slip Angles
The axle slip angle is defined as the angle between the direction of heading
and the direction of the tire centreline. This angle is modelled as the
arctangent of velocity components of each axle.

$$\alpha_f = \arctan\left(\frac{v + r \cdot a}{u}\right) - \delta$$

$$\alpha_r = \arctan\left(\frac{v - r \cdot b}{u}\right)$$

To simplify the derivation, we assume small angle variations in the axle slip
angles, $$\alpha$$. By this assumption, we linearize the function $$f(x) =
\arctan{\left(x\right)}$$ about an operating region around $$x = 0$$ such that
$$\arctan{\left(x\right)} \simeq x$$. Therefore, the slip angle equations
become:

$$\alpha_f = \frac{v + r \cdot a}{u} - \delta$$

$$\alpha_r = \frac{v - r \cdot b}{u}$$

Note: the singularity at $$u = 0$$ causes this model to only be valid for
non-zero longitudinal velocities.

## Base Derivation
Given the base assumptions, we can develop a set of linear differential
equations with lateral velocity and yaw velocity as state variables.

As the model is presented as a linear set of differential equations,
state-space and transfer function representations are provided.

## Derivation using Chassis Slip Angle as a State Variable
Depending on application, it may be useful to describe the vehicle using the
chassis slip angle.

The chassis slip angle is defined as the angle between the direction of heading
at the vehicle centre-of-gravity and the direction of the vehicle centreline.
This angle is modelled as the arctangent of velocity components at the vehicle
centre-of-gravity.

$$\beta = \arctan{\left(\frac{v}{u}\right)}$$

To simplify the derivation, we assume small angle variations in the chassis
slip angle, $$\beta$$. By this assumption, we linearize the function $$f(x) =
\arctan{\left(x\right)}$$ about an operating region around $$x = 0$$ such that
$$\arctan{(x)} \simeq x$$. Therefore, the chassis slip angle equations becomes:

$$\beta = \frac{v}{u}$$

We make the following substitutions to change the state variable from $$v$$ to
$$\beta$$:

$$v = u \cdot \beta$$

$$\dot{v} = u \cdot \dot{\beta}$$

#### Differential Form

$$\dot{\beta} = \frac{u (-C_f - C_r) \beta + (-C_f l_a + C_r l_b - mu^2) r}{mu^2} + \frac{C_f \delta}{mu}$$

$$\dot{r} = \frac{u (-C_f l_a + C_r l_b) \beta - (C_f l_a^2 + C_r l_b^2) r}{Iu} + \frac{u C_f l_a \delta}{I}$$


#### State-Space Form

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \dot{\beta} \\
  \dot{r}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{-C_f - C_r}{mu} & \frac{-C_f l_a + C_r l_b}{mu^2} - 1 \\
  \frac{-C_f l_a + C_r l_b}{I}  & \frac{-C_f l_a^2 - C_r l_b^2}{Iu} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  r
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{C_f}{mu} \\
  \frac{C_f l_a}{I}
\end{bmatrix}
\delta
$$

#### Transfer Function Form

$$
\frac{\beta(s)}{\delta(s)} = \frac{\frac{C_f}{mu} s + \frac{C_f}{Imu^2} (C_r l_a l_b + C_r l_b^2 - l_a mu^2)}{s^2 + \left(\frac{C_f + C_r}{mu} + \frac{C_f l_a^2 + C_r l_b^2}{Iu}\right) s + \frac{C_f C_r (l_a + l_b)^2}{Imu^2} + \frac{-C_f l_a + C_r l_b}{I}}
$$

$$
\frac{R(s)}{\delta(s)} = \frac{\frac{C_f l_a}{I} s + \frac{C_f C_r (l_a + l_b)}{Imu}}{s^2 + \left(\frac{C_f + C_r}{mu} + \frac{C_f l_a^2 + C_r l_b^2}{Iu}\right) s + \frac{C_f C_r (l_a + l_b)^2}{Imu^2} + \frac{-C_f l_a + C_r l_b}{I}}
$$

## Derivation using Cornering Compliances
Depending on application, it may be useful to describe the vehicle using the
axle cornering compliance instead of effective axle cornering stiffness.

The definition of cornering compliance is given as:

$$ D_f = \frac{W_f}{C_f}$$

$$ D_r = \frac{W_r}{C_r}$$

The vertical load on each axle, $$W_f$$ and $$W_r$$, can be expressed in terms of
the vehicle mass and geometry.

$$ W_f = \frac{mgl_b}{l_a + l_b} $$

$$ W_r = \frac{mgl_a}{l_a + l_b} $$

Given this relationship, the cornering compliance can be expressed by the following equations:

$$ D_f = \frac{mgl_b}{\left(l_a + l_b\right)C_f} $$

$$ D_r = \frac{mgl_a}{\left(l_a + l_b\right)C_r} $$

We make the following substitutions to change the variables from $$C_f$$, $$C_r$$ to
$$D_f$$, $$D_r$$:

$$ C_f = \frac{mgl_b}{\left(l_a + l_b\right)D_f} $$

$$ C_r = \frac{mgl_a}{\left(l_a + l_b\right)D_r} $$

#### Differential Form

$$\dot{\beta} = \frac{g u (-D_f l_a - D_r l_b) \beta + \left(-D_f D_r u^2 (l_a + l_b) +  (D_f - D_r) g l_a l_b \right) r}{D_f D_r u^2 (l_a + l_b)} + \frac{g l_b \delta}{D_f u (l_a + l_b)}$$

$$\dot{r} = \frac{m g u (D_f - D_r) (l_a l_b) \beta - (D_f l_b  - D_r l_a) (g l_a l_b m) r}{D_f D_r I u (l_a + l_b)} + \frac{g l_a l_b m \delta}{D_f I (l_a + l_b)}$$


#### State-Space Form

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  \dot{\beta} \\
  \dot{r}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  - \frac{g \left(D_f l_{a} + D_r l_{b}\right)}{D_f D_r u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} & \frac{- (D_f D_r u^2)(l_a + l_b) + (D_f - D_r) g l_a l_b}{D_f D_r u^2 \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} \\
  \frac{g l_{a} l_{b} m \left(D_f - D_r\right)}{D_f D_r I \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} & - \frac{g l_{a} l_{b} m \left(D_f l_{b} + D_r l_{a}\right)}{D_f D_r I u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
  \beta \\
  r
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{g l_{b}}{D_f u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} \\
  \frac{g l_{a} l_{b} m}{D_f I \left(l_{a} + l_b\right)}
\end{bmatrix}
\delta
$$



#### Transfer Function Form

$$
\frac{\beta(s)}{\delta(s)} = \frac{\frac{g l_{b}}{D_f u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} s +  \frac{g l_{a} l_{b} m \left(- D_r u^{2} + g l_{b}\right)}{D_f D_r I u^{2} \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}}{s^2 + \frac{\left(( D_f l_a + D_r l_b ) I + ( D_f l_b + D_r l_a ) m l_a l_b \right) g}{D_f D_r I u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}  s + \frac{\left((D_f - D_r) u^{2} + (l_{a} + l_{b}) g\right) g l_{a} l_{b} m }{D_f D_r I u^{2} \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} }
$$

$$
\frac{R(s)}{\delta(s)} = \frac{\frac{g l_{a} l_{b} m}{d_{f} I \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)} s + \frac{g^{2} l_{a} l_{b} m}{d_{f} d_{r} I u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}}{s^2 + \frac{\left(( D_f l_a + D_r l_b ) I + ( D_f l_b + D_r l_a ) m l_a l_b \right) g}{D_f D_r I u \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}  s + \frac{\left((D_f - D_r) u^{2} + (l_{a} + l_{b}) g\right) g l_{a} l_{b} m }{D_f D_r I u^{2} \left(l_{a} + l_{b}\right)}}
$$

## Conclusion
The amateur driver of today has more data available than ever before. Modern
data acquisition systems make it easier than ever to observe the vehicle state,
especially with the increased capabilities of modern safety systems. However,
making sense of this data remains a challenge, especially in the context of
vehicle handling.

The equations-of-motion provides the basis to study vehicle handling. The
advantage of this approach is the ability to quantify handling attributes and
qualify subjective observations made on the race track.

In the next few articles, we explore the classical techniques in analyzing
vehicle handling. We look back on the historic developments in vehicle dynamics
and see how there is still much to learn from the founders of the science.
