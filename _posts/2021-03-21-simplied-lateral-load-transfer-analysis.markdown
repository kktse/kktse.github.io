Handling modifications are synonymous with upgraded coilovers and anti-roll
bars. Replacing them with aftermarket versions do not guarantee the vehicle
will be improved. Depending the objectives, the vehicle can be adjusted to
accommodate the needs of the driver. This requires _tuning_ to achieve the
desired outcome.

While many factors contribute to the vehicle directional control, the choice of
spring rate and anti-roll bar size will have a big effect on the vehicle
handling characteristics. This controls the lateral load transfer distribution
and will affect how the tire vertical load transfer is distributed between the
four corners of the car.

Lateral load transfer analysis is useful because it provides an
order-of-magnitude indication of how the vehicle balance might change. We
present a set of _simplified_ equations to model the lateral load transfer based
on classical techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of this analysis, we
use kinematic data from the Acura RSX to compute handling metrics before and
after a setup change.

## Bringing balance to the vertical forces

![9th gen civic](/assets/images/2021-03-21/civic-jy-tmp.jpg)

In an ideal analysis, vehicle balance would be characterized by studying the
yawing and lateral dynamics directly. Several techniques exist, including the
[on-centre handling study of the #551 2012 Honda Civic Si][1] we performed in 2018.
Tire force and moment data is often required for such analysis and is unlikely
to be available to individual analysts.

In the absence of a complete vehicle model, we must consider alternative
mechanisms that are known to be correlated with vehicle handling. The lateral
load transfer distribution is a metric commonly used to quantify the handling
balance of a vehicle. Closely related is the roll stiffness distribution which
can also be used as a metric for handling balance.

Pneumatic tires are assumed to be _load sensitive_ meaning that the peak
coefficient of friction is reduced with vertical load. Therefore, lateral load
transfer decreases the total lateral force that can be generated by the tires.
Modifying the vehicle with springs, anti-roll bars or geometry controls how the
load transfer is distributed between the front and rear axles, thereby changing
the vehicle handling balance.

## Lateral load transfer

Lateral load transfer is a physical phenomenon that causes the tire vertical
load on each wheel to change as a lateral force is applied to the vehicle centre
of gravity. Simply put, it is the change in tire vertical load when the vehicle
is cornering.

In this section, we will show the equations to compute a lateral load transfer
distribution (LLTD). Astute readers will recognize that these equations are
highly simplified. This is _intentional_. Our purpose is to obtain an
_order-of-magnitude_ indicator of the _change_ in vehicle balance. We favour
_relative correlation_ over _absolute correlation_.

For more mathematically focused formulations, consider additional reading from
texts such as _Jazar_ or _Pacejka_.

### Model assumptions

The lateral load transfer model follows a series of assumptions to simplify the
analysis. The initial assumption is that the vehicle is symmetrical and is
analyzed while on-centre. This means that:

- The neutral roll axis lies on the vehicle centre plane
- The vehicle centre of gravity lies on the vehicle centre plane
- The tire lateral forces are equally split between the left and right wheels

This assumption eliminates _jacking forces_ from appearing in the analysis.

To reduce the amount of data needed with respect to the vehicle mass properties,
we assume that the total vehicle mass can be substituted for the chassis mass.
This means that:

- The suspended mass centre of gravity is in the same position as the vehicle centre of gravity
- The unsprung mass is negligible in comparison to the suspended mass
- The tire vertical stiffness is negligible

With regards to the model, the following simplifying assumptions are made:

- The load transfer can be analyzed at each axle independently
- The lateral acceleration experienced at each axle is the same

These assumptions allow the model simplify into a pair of two-dimensional
statics problems that are trivial to solve.

### In a rigid body

![load transfer, rigid body](/assets/images/2021-03-21/load-transfer-rigid-body.png)

The simplest case for studying lateral load transfer is a rigid body. In
steady-state, the sum of the roll moments must equal to zero. Tire vertical
forces are developed at the tire contact patches when a lateral force is applied
at the vehicle centre of gravity. The magnitude of the change in tire vertical
load is given by the following:

$$ |\Delta F*z| = \frac{mh*{CG}}{t} a_y $$

Where:

- $$ \Delta F_z $$ is the overall change in tire vertical load [$$N$$]
- $$ m $$ is the overall mass of the vehicle [$$kg$$]
- $$ a_y $$ is the lateral acceleration experienced at the vehicle centre of gravity [$$m/s^2$$]
- $$ h\_{CG} $$ is the centre of gravity height above the ground [$$m$$]
- $$ t $$ is the vehicle average track [$$m$$]

Note that the roll centre and roll stiffness do not appear in this relationship.
The total _magnitude_ of load transfer cannot be changed by adjusting suspension
components; however, the _distribution_ of this load transfer can be controlled
through the suspension elements.

### Roll centres and link loads

![load transfer, link loads](/assets/images/2021-03-21/load-transfer-link-loads.png)

The roll centre is a point on the axle plane in which forces can be resolved
into the suspended mass. In the symmetrical case, forces resolve into the roll
centre without creating a roll moment about the suspended mass. Thus, an
equivalent lateral force originating the tire contact patches could be a lateral
force of equivalent magnitude applied at the roll centre plus a roll moment that
is reacted through the suspension links. We call this the _link load transfer_.
It is also commonly called the _inelastic_ load transfer, or the _geometric_
load transfer.

$$ |\Delta F*{z,g,f}| = \frac{m_fh*{RC,f}}{t_f} a_y $$

$$ |\Delta F*{z,g,r}| = \frac{m_rh*{RC,r}}{t_r} a_y $$

Where:

- $$ \Delta F\_{z,g,i} $$ is the change in tire vertical load for axle $$i$$ due to link load transfer effects [$$N$$]
- $$ m_i $$ is the equivalent mass of axle $$i$$ [$$kg$$]
- $$ h\_{RC,i} $$ is the height of the roll centre above the ground for axle $$i$$ [$$m$$]
- $$ t_i $$ is the track width for axle $$i$$ [$$m$$]

### Roll stiffnesses

![load transfer, roll stiffness](/assets/images/2021-03-21/load-transfer-roll-stiffness.png)

The forces acting into the suspended mass through the roll centre generates a
roll moment about the suspended mass centre of gravity. This can equivalently be
thought of as a lateral force applied at the suspended mass centre of gravity
plus a roll moment generated by the distance between the roll centre and
suspended mass centre of gravity. Beginning with a roll moment equilibrium:

$$ (k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}) \phi = a*y\Big(m_f(h*{CG} - h*{RC,f}) + m_r(h*{CG} - h\_{RC,r})\Big) $$

$$ \phi = \frac{m*f(h*{CG} - h*{RC,f}) + m_r(h*{CG} - h*{RC,r})}{k*{\phi,f} + k\_{\phi,r}} a_y $$

Where:

- $$ \phi $$ is the roll angle of the suspended mass [$$rad$$]
- $$ k\_{\phi, i} $$ is the equivalent roll stiffness of axle $$i$$ [$$Nm/rad$$]
- $$ g $$ is the acceleration due to earth's gravity [$$m/s^2$$]

The change in tire vertical load due to the roll moment reacted through the
springs is simply the roll angle multiplied by the roll stiffness divided by the
track width.

$$ |\Delta F*{z,e,f}| = \frac{k*{\phi,f}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_f}\Bigg] a_y $$

$$ |\Delta F*{z,e,r}| = \frac{k*{\phi,r}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_r}\Bigg] a_y $$

Where:

- $$ \Delta F\_{z,e,i} $$ is the change in tire vertical load due to the roll stiffness load transfer for axle $$i$$ [$$N$$]

This component of tire vertical load transfer is called the _roll stiffness load
transfer_. It is also commonly called the _elastic_ load transfer.

### Total load transfer

![load transfer, summation](/assets/images/2021-03-21/load-transfer-summation.png)

The total lateral load transfer experienced by each axle is the sum of the link
load transfer and the roll stiffness load transfer.

$$ |\Delta F*{z,f}| = \frac{m_fh*{RC,f}}{t*f} a_y + \frac{k*{\phi,f}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_f}\Bigg] a_y $$

$$ |\Delta F*{z,r}| = \frac{m_fh*{RC,r}}{t*r} a_y + \frac{k*{\phi,r}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_r}\Bigg] a_y $$

Differentiating the change in tire vertical load with respect to the lateral
acceleration gives us the lateral load transfer sensitivity. This is the
incremental change in the tire vertical load per unit lateral acceleration.

$$ \frac{d|\Delta F*{z,f}|}{da_y} = \frac{m_fh*{RC,f}}{t*f} + \frac{k*{\phi,f}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_f}\Bigg] $$

$$ \frac{d|\Delta F*{z,r}|}{da_y} = \frac{m_fh*{RC,r}}{t*r} + \frac{k*{\phi,r}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}}\Bigg[\frac{m_f(h_{CG} - h_{RC,f}) + m_r(h_{CG} - h_{RC,r})}{t_r}\Bigg] $$

### Lateral load transfer distribution

The lateral load transfer distribution is the ratio between the axle lateral
load transfer sensitivity and the total vehicle lateral load transfer
sensitivity.

$$ LLTD*f = \frac{\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,f}|}{da*y}}{\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,f}|}{da*y}+\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,r}|}{da_y}} $$

$$ LLTD*r = \frac{\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,r}|}{da*y}}{\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,f}|}{da*y}+\frac{d|\Delta F*{z,r}|}{da_y}} $$

### Roll stiffness distribution

In the absence of kinematic data, the link load transfer component may be
omitted to obtain the roll stiffness distribution (RSD).

$$ RSD*f = \frac{k*{\phi,f}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}} $$

$$ RSD*r = \frac{k*{\phi,r}}{k*{\phi,f} + k*{\phi,r}} $$

Note that the values of $$k_\phi$$ are roll stiffnesses which include the effect
of elastic elements and their motion ratios, and the track width.

## Case Study

![rsx](/assets/images/2021-03-21/rsx-tmp.jpg)

To demonstrate the applicability of load transfer modelling, we will compute the
lateral load transfer distribution for the 2002 Acura RSX. Using kinematic data
generated from our [analysis of the Acura RSX suspension][4], we can compute the
lateral load transfer distribution before and after a setup change to ascertain
its effect.

### Target vehicle

We will analyze the Acura RSX in two configurations: stock and modified. The
stock configuration is a baseline that represents the design intent of the
manufacturer. The modified configuration represents a vehicle with mild bolt-on
performance parts. These parts do not change the underlying suspension geometry
and do not interfere with the roadworthiness of the vehicle. The parameters for
each configuration are shown below.

| Parameter                                 | Stock | Modified |

| **Height, ride reference, rear** [mm]     | 240   | 181      |

### Compute the roll stiffness

For Acura RSX suspension, there are two elastic elements that contribute to the
roll stiffness: the corner springs and the anti-roll bar. Assuming that the
vehicle acts in pure roll, the roll stiffness contribution by the corner springs
can be computed using the following.

$$ k*{\phi,cs,f} = \frac{1}{2} k*{cs,f} \textrm{MR}\_{cs,f}^2 t_f^2 $$

$$ k*{\phi,cs,r} = \frac{1}{2} k*{cs,r} \textrm{MR}\_{cs,r}^2 t_r^2 $$

Where:

- $$ k\_{\phi,cs,i} $$ is the roll stiffness contribution from the corner springs on axle $$i$$ [$$Nm/rad$$]
- $$ k\_{cs,i} $$ is the linear spring stiffness of the corner spring on axle $$i$$ [$$N/m$$]
- $$ \textrm{MR}\_{cs,i} $$ is the motion ratio between the corner spring and the wheel centre displacement on axle $$i$$ [$$m/m$$]

The anti-roll bar is assumed to be a solid, straight cylindrical bar connecting
the left and right wheels over an effective length. The resistive roll moment is
provided by its torsional stiffness. Assuming that the vehicle acts in pure
roll, the roll stiffness contribution by the anti-roll bar can be estimated
using the bar dimensions and material properties.

$$ k\_{\theta,arb,f} = \frac{\pi D_f^4G}{32l_f} $$

$$ k\_{\theta,arb,r} = \frac{\pi D_r^4G}{32l_r} $$

$$ k*{\phi,arb,f} = k*{\theta,arb,f} \textrm{MR}\_{arb,f}^2 t_f^2 $$

$$ k*{\phi,arb,r} = k*{\theta,arb,r} \textrm{MR}\_{arb,r}^2 t_r^2 $$

Where:

- $$ k\_{\theta,arb,i} $$ is the torsional stiffness of the anti-roll bar on axle $$i$$ [$$Nm/rad$$]
- $$ k\_{\phi,arb,i} $$ is the roll stiffness contribution from the anti-roll bar on axle $$i$$ [$$Nm/rad$$]
- $$ D_i $$ is the anti-roll bar diameter on axle $$i$$ [$$m$$]
- $$ l_i $$ is the effective anti-roll bar length on axle $$i$$ [$$m$$]
- $$ G $$ is the shear modulus of bar material [$$Pa$$]
- $$ \textrm{MR}\_{arb,i} $$ is the anti-roll bar motion ratio between the twist angle of the anti-roll bar and the wheel centre displacement on axle $$i$$ [$$rad/m$$]

The corner springs and the anti-roll bar are configured in parallel, meaning
that the roll stiffness per axle is simply the summation of the two stiffnesses.

$$ k*{\phi,f} = k*{\phi,cs,f} + k\_{\phi,arb,f} $$

$$ k*{\phi,r} = k*{\phi,cs,r} + k\_{\phi,arb,r} $$

Where:

- $$ k\_{\phi,i} $$ is the roll stiffness of axle $$i$$ [$$Nm/rad$$]

The following values for the roll stiffness are computed for the vehicle under
study.

| Parameter                          | Stock | Modified |
| ---------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| **Roll stiffness, front** [Nm/deg] | 1027  | 1395     |
| **Roll stiffness, rear** [Nm/deg]  | 1004  | 1686     |
| **Roll stiffness** [Nm/deg]        | 2031  | 3081     |

### Results

With all input quantities known, they can be substituted into the load transfer
equations. The lateral load transfer distribution and other metrics are
summarized in the table below. Additional metrics have been included to
highlight how the fidelity of the model will affect the results.

| Metric                                           | Stock | Modified | Delta (±/%)    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- | -------- | -------------- |
| **Weight distribution** [%]                      | 61    | 61       | -              |
| **Spring rate distribution, rear** [%]           | 62.1  | 63.4     | +1.3 (+2.1%)   |
| **Wheel rate distribution, rear** [%]            | 40.3  | 37.1     | -3.2 (-7.9%)   |
| **Roll stiffness distribution, rear** [%]        | 49.4  | 54.7     | +5.3 (+10.7%)  |
| **Lateral load transfer distribution, rear** [%] | 50.2  | 63.6     | +13.4 (+26.7%) |

In the modified configuration, the lateral load transfer distribution moves
rearward +13.4%. This is a 26.7% relative increase compared to the stock
configuration. Our subjective on-track evaluation suggests the modified
configuration has a very aggressive handling balance. This observation is
correlated with change in the lateral load transfer distribution.

The roll stiffness distribution does not capture the effect of the roll centre.
While the directionality of the metric is correct, it suggests a change that is
about half the magnitude suggested by the lateral load transfer distribution.

The spring rate and wheel rate distributions are limited to vertical dynamics
only, so the effect of the increased rear anti-roll bar diameter is not
captured. Interestingly, it seems as if the corner spring rates were
deliberately chosen in the modified configuration to maintain the vertical
stiffness distribution.

## Final comments

Vehicle analysis and handling metrics are indispensible tools for chassis setup.
In this analysis, we computed the lateral load transfer distribution and the
roll stiffness distribution. These metrics are highly correlated with vehicle
balance and can be used to ascertain the effect of new springs and anti-roll
bars on vehicle handling.

Vehicle understanding is an important aspect to success. By understanding the
underlying mechanisms of vehicle performance, we can have confidence in our
setup decisions. Performance and cost are not mutually exclusive. Using a
systems approach, we can determine the most efficient pathway to success and
maximize the "bang-for-your-buck" of your project build. This is just one of the
tools we use at [Formula Delta][3] to achieve this.
