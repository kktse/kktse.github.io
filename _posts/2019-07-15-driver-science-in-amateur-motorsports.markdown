Success in motorsport requires total system performance; car and driver must
work in harmony to extract all available performance in the system.

On the vehicle side, advancements in vehicle performance and safety is the
result of decades of automotive research. Despite the ever increasing knowledge
available to the grassroots motorsport community of today, the driver remains a
major determinant of performance.

We conducted a literature review to better understand the current research in
high performance driver development. This is a brief summary of our findings:

# "Driver Science"
In a general review of sport sciences in motorsport, Potkanowicz and Mendel
liken the racing driver to an athlete. Sports science aims to improve the
fitness level of an athlete to reduce stress on the body during competition. A
training program that applies the principle of specificity requires
understanding the physical stressors faced by the athlete; however, limited
published research into driving-specific stressors limits the application
targeted task-specific training. The term "driver science" is coined to
describe the role of the driver in the car-driver system and to encourage
further research in this field.

More succinctly, Potkanowicz and Mendel make the following comparison:

> Not to study the driver is to ignore a very important part of the driver-car
> system; not to have empirical data available about what the driver is
> experiencing in the cockpit is analogous to ignoring all the data related to
> engine performance and then expecting the engine to run well or to last the
> whole race.

# Perceptual-Cognitive Hierarchy
In a document analysis of professional coaching literature, Lappi categorizes
_deliberate practice_ techniques in terms of a cognitive hierarchy. The McRuer
Hierarchy describes three cognitive processes involved in driving:

* **Navigation**: track representation and route selection
* **Guidance**: visual preview and situational awareness
* **Control**: sensory feedback and motor commands

After categorizing the examples of deliberate practice, Lappi describes each
task in terms of the underlying cognitive mechanisms. Deliberate practice tasks
classified as navigational emphasized visualization of the track environment
and visualization of the desired path (ie. racing line). This implies that
long-term memory is critical in high-level executive path planning and chunking
of relevant reference points based on prior experience.

High speed corner negotiation therefore requires a high degree of
perceptual-cognitive expertise, and cannot be reduced down to a feedback
wayfinding task. Lappi's review provides a basis in which the driving task can
be broken down into constitutive cognitive processes.

# Gaze Control
In a comparison between racing and non-racing drivers, van Leeuwen uses
eye-tracking in a driving simulator to find differences in gaze control. The
study enlisted seven racing drivers and ten non-racing drivers to drive four
ten-minute driving sessions in a fixed-base driving simulator. Eye gaze in
non-racing drivers corresponded to the tangent point model, whereas racing
drivers displayed variable gaze behaviour and larger head rotations compared to
non-racing drivers.  Differences are also found in lap time performance, with
racing drivers displaying higher levels of steer, throttle and brake activity.

Laboratory test of drivers (racing and non-racing) by Guidetti et al. applied
saccade and attentional tests to measure visual performance. Saccadic
suppression occurs due to motion blur during eye movement, causing a
suppression of visual perception. This loss of visual perception, even
momentarily, can impact sensory-motor decision making required for high-speed
vehicle maneuvering. Racing drivers displayed faster reaction and accuracy in
the saccade test compared to non-racing drivers, and can better generate a
corrective antisaccade in the presence of visual distractions.

Driving is inherently a visual task. Increasing the visual preview window and
developing visual strategies that reduces saccadic movements can be trained to
improve driver performance.

## "Looking Ahead" - A Use Case
The pervasive use of the phrase "look ahead!" demonstrates an important aspect
of high speed vehicle maneuvering. The end objective is to increase the visual
preview window perceived by the driver. While the phrase is seemingly simple to
understand, deconstructing the phrase reveals multiple cognitive steps.

At the guidance level, one must have an internal representation of the path
such that one knows _what_ to look at. Path generation relies on long-term
memory to recall the most effective route. Because driving occurs on a
scene-by-scene basis, the line is generated using key landmarks of the track.
Preparation and reflection of known trajectories can help encode this
information into long-term memory.

Increasing the visual preview horizon is the fundamental goal of looking ahead.
The tangent point model suggests that drivers typically look at the apex point
of the upcoming corner. In contrast, racing drivers adjust their gaze to the
outside just as they begin to turn into the corner. Visual preview is
anticipatory based on knowing the trajectory _a-priori_ to entering the corner.
Looking ahead allows you to take advantage of this information to maneuver the
vehicle.

Looking ahead also changes how your eyes and head move. In a comparison between
racing drivers and non-racing drivers, it is shown that racing drivers rotate
their heads in a way that maintains a zero head-to-eye angle. Using your eyes
to look ahead can be considered undesirable due to saccadic suppression, and
therefore switching to physically rotating your head may be a desirable
strategy to keep you focused on the path ahead.

## Closing Remarks
Driver development and the application of "driver science" is still in its
infancy. Vehicle development is comparatively simple given the complexity of
human cognition and physiology; however, this does not preclude us from seeking
improvements in this area. If the driver remains to be a major determinant of
vehicle performance, then the notion of driver development should be subject to
study proportionate to its importance. In the same way the vehicle can be
analyzed, the same should be said about driver development. It is through
better understanding of the car-driver system can total system performance be
achieved.
