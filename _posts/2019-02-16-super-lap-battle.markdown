Time Attack is a form of motorsport to compete for the best time. With Super
Lap Battle being this weekend, I wanted to know the end-of-day team rankings
and lap times. The timing source does not aggregate results from all sessions.
As a spectator, this makes it difficult to follow along with the overall
competition.

This is an exercise in data wrangling and data visualization. I used Pandas for
data manipulation and Bokeh for plotting. I used the live timing feed as the
data source.
