During [Apex Performance Engineering][1]'s inaugural year of competing in Ontario
Time Attack, we emphasized driver development as an important area to improve.
We know that high-speed vehicle maneuvering is a complex task that puts the
driver under cognitive, physical and psychological stress. What we do not know
is how we are affected by these demands in our unique case.

We measure driver workload using the NASA Task Load Index administered during
Ontario Time Attack events six and seven. The purpose is to quantify the
driver's subjective experience and correlate it to driver development
strategies.

# Shannonville Motorsports Park - A New Challenge
Ontario Time Attack events six and seven posed a unique challenge. Because of
our limited experience with the race track, the driver faced an additional
challenge of learning the course with limited prior knowledge. We participated
in a lapping event in 'long' configuration one week prior to the Ontario Time
Attack weekend which took place on both 'pro' and 'long' configurations.

As a driver coach, how can I support the driver achieve peak performance as
quickly as possible?  This question was particularly important because we would
only have so much time to deliver on performance objectives.

# NASA Task Load Index - Measuring Workload

Because of the challenge of learning a new track, _workload_ as a metric is
interesting because the task changes over time with more experience. Session
types varied from lapping, qualifying and competition, providing a diverse set
of conditions the driver must adapt to.

We used the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) to capture the driver's subjective
evaluation of workload. When permissible, the driver would complete the NASA
TLX rating procedure after a session. The procedure asks the subject to rate
the relevancy of six factors to the task.

The NASA TLX rating system is unique in that it combines the weighted
importance of each factor with the magnitude of their subjective rating. This
increases the sensitivity of the rating scale. Overall workload is derived as a
combination of the adjusted scores of each factor.

# Workload Results
As we developed our driver development program, we questioned whether the
competitive aspect added to the perceived workload by the driver. I
hypothesized that the driver would experience higher workload due to
competitive pressures.  To test this hypothesis, lets look at the overall
workload and identify the measurements by session type.

{: refdef}

Contrary to the hypothesis, lapping sessions were considered the most
demanding. Because it was our first time on this track, the additional
challenge of learning it increased the overall workload.

This leads us to another question; how did workload change over time as we
progressed? Let's look at the components of workload in chronological order.
This give us an estimate of how workload changes as we gained experience.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![adjusted_workload](/assets/images/2019-09-14/Adjusted Workload.svg){:class="img-responsive"}
{: refdef}

Majority of the workload is caused by three factors: mental demand, physical
demand and temporal demand. Early on, the largest contributor to overall
workload was mental demand. However, as we gained more experience, mental
demand contributed less to overall workload and is overtaken by physical demand
to become the largest contributor. Temporal demand varies between sessions and
is less correlated with time.

Since the NASA TLX rating procedure consists of two parts, we wanted to
understand how adjusted scores differed from the raw rating by the driver.
Let's update our charts to look at raw scores instead of adjusted scores.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![raw_workload](/assets/images/2019-09-14/Raw Workload.svg){:class="img-responsive"}
{: refdef}

Raw workload scores are relatively consistent between measurements. Some
subtleties are noteworthy; performance and mental demand decrease as time
progresses. However, the overall consistency of the raw ratings suggests that
the variable nature of the overall workload is caused by changes in the
importance of each factor, not by the magnitude which the driver scored each
demand.

# Driver Feedback
Qualitative understanding of the driver's experience brought much needed
insight into the results. Driving is highly experiential, so articulating
subjective experiences is not always simple. These results gives us a
foundation to discuss our progress.

The challenge of learning the track dominated our discussion. Despite the
substantial preparation and research put into the track prior to lapping, the
driver found it cognitively demanding to associate the new information with the
preparation. It was only until the driver had a high fidelity mental model of
the track did he feel ready to maneuver the vehicle at the limit.

As the driver began to take full advantage of the vehicle's potential, physical
demand became the primary contributor of workload. The cause of this increase
is two-fold: operating the vehicle at the limit requires more physical movement
of the controls which in turn increases the g-forces acting on the driver.

# Driver Development Plan - A Personalized Approach
The goal of training to improve fitness levels is to minimize the stress the
body experiences during competition. Because each driver is unique in their
experience and needs, a personalized approach is necessary to focus on areas of
greatest importance.

One aspect of high speed vehicle maneuvering is driving technique. This is not
in the scope of our discussion. Rather, we focus on preparing the driver
physically and mentally to successfully execute their chosen driving strategy.
It is noteworthy that the three largest contributors to overall workload are
factors imposed on the driver due to the nature of the task, not due to the
interaction between the driver and the task.

Here are a few strategies we brainstormed that may help condition the driver
face the imposed demands:

| Demand | Strategy |
| ------ | -------- |
| __Mental__ | Perceptual-cognitive training, visualization |
| __Physical__ | Resistance training, heat acclimation, reaction time, diet and nutrition |
| __Temporal__ | Rhythm training, multitasking |

Not all strategies require active training. Combating physical fatigue could
involve proper nutrition and hydration. Meeting nutritional requirements can be
difficult at the race track; packing your own lunch and snacks could help
reduce fatigue and therefore improve driving performance. Reducing temporal
demand may be as simple as scheduling lapping sessions well in advance to give
yourself enough time to learn the track without feeling pressured.

Active training strategies would replicate driving workloads to prepare your
body for high performance driving. Resistance training would focus on
strengthening the neck and upper body to allow the driver to maintain vehicle
control under high g-loading. Aspects such as balance and coordination would
aim to increase the driver's perceptual sensitivity to vehicle balance.

# Closing Remarks
Tweaking the performance of the driver is equally - if not _more_ important
as improving the performance of the vehicle. The NASA TLX workload assessment
provided insight into demand factors affecting the driver. Being able to
communicate these concerns in a concise and quantifiable way allows us to
address the concerns in meaningful way and remove barriers to achieving high
performance.

Were we successful in achieving our performance goals? At our first lapping
day, we set a baseline lap time of 2:06.16. By the end of event seven, we had
set a lap time of 2:01.53. We feel there are merits to accelerated driver
development, though there is still much opportunity to improve total system
performance.
