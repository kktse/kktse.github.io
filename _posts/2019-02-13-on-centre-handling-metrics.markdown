Welcome to the Ontario Time Attack debrief files, a series of articles where we
answer vehicle dynamics questions we always wanted to ask, but could not tackle
during the racing season. In this instalment, we quantify vehicle handling by
computing handling metrics using the linear single-track vehicle model.

# Foreword
_We have dedicated a lot of time into identifying the [understeer
gradient](jekyll/update/2018/12/01/understeer-gradient-identification.html) and
[cornering
compliances](jekyll/update/2019/01/06/cornering-compliance-identification.html)
in our previous articles, but we did not explain our motivation. Here is a bit
of an explaination:_

Ontario Time Attack is an IPAX equalized series. Modifications made to the
vehicle are equalized to offset the expected performance enhancement.
Therefore, the challenge of OTA is twofold: to maximize the vehicle performance
per unit performance index (PI), and to pilot the vehicle as quickly as
possible during the timed sessions.

In a competitive environment, simultaneously developing the car and driver is
extremely difficult. Our strategy is to use vehicle dynamic simulation to
develop the vehicle. This is advantageous because vehicle development can
continue without the need of track time.

We take the view that success in the series requires total system performance -
car and driver must work harmoniously to achieve maximum performance. However,
for practical reasons we opt to focus on driver development at the race track,
and use vehicle dynamic simulation back home in the pits.

# Handling Metrics
Driving is inherently a subjective experience relying on human input and
feedback to control the vehicle. Handling metrics provide an objective measure
of this experience.

Objective measurements are correlated to subjective evaluation. _Corolla et
al._ show that frequency response metrics are highly correlated to subjective
vehicle evaluations. For example, the yaw rate frequency response is related to
notions of controllability and impulse control.

By this relationship, we strive to understand objective measures of vehicle
handling in the understanding that there is strong correlation to on-track
subjective evaluation.

We present a variety of on-centre handling metrics from a computer simulation
of a linear single-track vehicle model.

# Experimental Setup
We will be evaluating the #551 2012 Honda Civic Si for its on-centre handling
characteristics. All evaluation is performed in computer simulation using the
vehicle model developed in our previous articles.

The following parameters are used to represent the vehicle:

| Symbol | Value | Unit | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| $$a$$  | 0.996 | m    | Distance from CG to front axle |
| $$b$$  | 1.624 | m    | Distance from CG to rear axle |
| $$m$$  | 1450  | kg   | Vehicle mass |
| $$I$$  | 2345  | kg m<sup>2</sup> | Vehicle yaw inertia |
| $$D_f$$  | 9.6   | deg/g | Cornering compliance, front |
| $$D_r$$  | 4.1   | deg/g | Cornering compliance, rear |
| $$N$$  | 16.08 | - | Steering ratio |


# Step Response
We begin by evaluating the system response to a step input in the time domain.
This is the time response of the system when the input is instantaneously
changed from zero to a non-zero value. This is a good response to study as it
has on-track implications - it can be thought of as an analogue to corner
entry.

It is important to note that the unit step function is an idealized input; a
step function is impossible to achieve in reality. However, its ubiquity in
literature provides a foundation for study.

We start by looking at the yaw rate and chassis slip angle response to a 100
deg SWA step. Four speeds are shown to demonstrate the speed effect on the
response.
![civicsi_step](/assets/images/2019-02-13/civicsi_step.png)

We can already see some interesting handling behaviour. As the velocity
increases, the yaw rate becomes more oscillatory and takes longer to settle.
The chassis slip angle is even more peculiar; at low speed the steady-state
response is positive, but at higher speeds the response is negative.
Additionally for these higher speeds, the chassis slip angle initially goes in
the opposite direction to its steady-state value!

We can quantify some of these characteristics by parameterizing the response.
Borrowing terminology from control theory lets us describe our observations more precisely.
* **Rise Time** - time to achieve 90% of steady-state
* **Overshoot** - maximum percentage over the steady-state value
* **Settling Time** - time taken for the signal to stay within a Â±2% band of steady-state
* **Steady-State Gain** - the magnitude of the output over input when the signal is no longer changing

These metrics are visualized in the figure below:
![step_metrics](/assets/images/2019-02-13/step_metrics.png)

By extracting these metrics over the working velocity of the vehicle, we can
show the evolution of the step response in terms of these metrics.

![civicsi_stepmetrics](/assets/images/2019-02-13/civicsi_stepmetrics.png)

There are a few key observations that can be made:
* The yaw rate gain is fairly insensitive to speed. In other words, the
  steady-state yaw rate gain will remain similar across the working speed of
  the vehicle.
* The yaw rate response becomes less controlled as speed increases. Observe the
  increase in the overshoot and the settling time as speed increases.
* The steady-state chassis slip angle gain crosses zero at around 50 km/h. This
  is the _tangent speed_. The chassis slip angle response differs above and
  below this speed. The metrics misbehave near the tangent speed partly because
  of the mathematical singularity at this point.
* The yaw rate and chassis slip angle rise and settle out at varying points in
  time depending on speed. Below the tangent speed, the chassis slip angle is
  first to rise. However, above the tangent speed, the yaw rate is the first to
  rise.

# Frequency Response
Frequency domain analysis provides an alternative - if a bit abstract - view
into the vehicle response. Studying the vehicle response in the frequency
domain allows application of literature in control theory to analyze the car.

The Bode plot describes the magnitude and phase response of the system with
respect to frequency of the input. The frequency response of the yaw rate,
chassis slip angle and lateral acceleration with respect to the steering wheel
angle are shown on a linear scale.

![civicsi_bode](/assets/images/2019-02-13/civicsi_bode.png)

Findings from the step response results are confirmed in the frequency domain.
As speed increases, we see the resonant peak increase in the yaw rate response.
This is consistent with the step response metrics; the yaw rate overshoot and
settling time increases as speed increases. The chassis slip angle is less
resonant, however the steady-state response is 180 degrees out of phase above
70 km/h.

Another way to visualize the frequency response is to understand the placement
of system poles and zeros. We show the variation in pole/zero placement with
velocity in a root locus plot.

![civicsi_rootlocus](/assets/images/2019-02-13/civicsi_rootlocus.png)

Yaw rate, chassis slip angle and lateral acceleration all share the underlying
system dynamics as they share the same pole locations. The variation in
response is attributable to different placement of system zeros.

For the chassis slip angle, the zero crosses over into the right-hand plane as
the velocity increases. The introduction of a non-minimum phase zero explains
the undershoot experienced above the tangent speed.

Lateral acceleration has two real zeros at low speeds. As speed increases, the
zeros become complex conjugate pairs. These zeros become highly oscillatory at
high speeds.

# Summary
The purpose of developing handling metrics is to describe specific aspects of
vehicle handling in a quantifiable way. These metrics are highly correlated to
subjective evaluation, therefore understanding these objective measures can
help explain subjective driver feedback.

Vehicle dynamic simulation delivers insights more rapidly than on-track
testing, and without the need of laboratory-grade instrumentation. In this
example, we were able to study the vehicle with computer simulation in a way
that is not realistically possible due to facility and time constraints.

With on-centre handling metrics, we established the baseline transient handling
performance. To take the analysis to the next level, we can take advantage of
our vehicle simulation to evaluate the influence of vehicle parameters on the
open-loop response. As we begin preparations for the new season, understanding
the sensitivity to vehicle changes will help us determine which modifications
will have the biggest impact.
