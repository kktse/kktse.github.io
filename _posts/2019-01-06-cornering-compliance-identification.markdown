Welcome to the Ontario Time Attack debrief files, a series of articles where we
answer vehicle dynamics questions we always wanted to ask, but could not tackle
during the racing season. In this instalment, we perform a pulse steer test to
identify vehicle handling properties.

# Transient Handling

The understeer gradient is a measure of steady-state vehicle handling. However,
in order to wholistically evaluate handling performance, it is necessary to
analyze both steady-state and transient vehicle responses.

The [linear single-track vehicle](/jekyll/update/2018/09/18/single-track-bicycle.html) provides a
foundational model to study on-centre vehicle handling. System identification
allows analytical examination of handling properties in both steady-state and
transient maneuvers.

# Understeer, Defined

In our [last article](/jekyll/update/2018/12/01/understeer-gradient-identification.html),
we defined understeer as the tendency for a vehicle to require more (or less)
steering input relative to the Ackermann steer angle.  The gain due to lateral
acceleration is the understeer gradient.

$$\delta = \frac{L}{R} + K a_y$$

Where:

* $$\delta$$ is the steering angle [$$rad$$]
* $$L$$ is the wheelbase of the car [$$m$$]
* $$R$$ is the radius of the turn [$$m$$]
* $$a_y$$ is the lateral acceleration [$$m/s^2$$]
* $$K$$ is the understeer gradient [$$\frac{rad}{m/s^2}$$]

Equivalently, the understeering tendency can be described as the difference in
the front and rear slip angles.

$$\delta = \frac{L}{R} + (\alpha_f - \alpha_r)$$

Where:

* $$\alpha_f$$ represents the front axle effective slip angle [$$rad$$]
* $$\alpha_r$$ represents the rear axle effective slip angle [$$rad$$]

Combining both definitions of understeer yields the following relationship:

$$K = \frac{1}{a_y} (\alpha_f - \alpha_r)$$

We assume that the front and rear axles experience the same lateral
acceleration, $$a_y$$. Equating the tire force to lateral acceleration
experienced by each axle yields the following relationship:

$$m_f a_y = \alpha_f C_f$$

$$m_r a_y = \alpha_r C_r$$

Where:

* $$m_f$$ represents the equivalent mass of the front axle [$$kg$$]
* $$m_r$$ represents the equivalent mass of the rear axle [$$kg$$]
* $$C_f$$ represents the front axle effective cornering stiffness [$$N/rad$$]
* $$C_r$$ represents the axle axle effective cornering stiffness [$$N/rad$$]

Rearranging and solving for the front and rear slip angles:

$$\alpha_f = \frac{m_f a_y}{C_f}$$

$$\alpha_r = \frac{m_r a_y}{C_r}$$

Substituting the front and rear slip angles yields the following definition of
the understeer gradient.

$$K = \frac{m_f}{C_f} - \frac{m_r}{C_r} = D_f - D_r$$

Where:

* $$D_f$$ represents the front axle cornering compliance [$$\frac{rad}{m/s^2}$$]
* $$D_r$$ represents the rear axle cornering compliance [$$\frac{rad}{m/s^2}$$]

The understeer gradient can therefore be understood as the difference between
the front and rear cornering compliances. This definition is mathematically
consistent with the earlier definition of the understeer gradient. Noteworthy
of mention is the exclusion of the steer angle term in the cornering compliance
definition of the  understeer gradient.

# Experimental Setup

![ddt_civicsi](/assets/images/2019-01-06/civicsi_ddt_pits.jpg)

The target vehicle is a 2012 Honda Civic Si Coupe equipped with adjustable
coilovers, staggered wheel sizing, bucket racing seat and roll bar. All data is
collected with an Autosport Labs RaceCapture/Pro Mk2 data acquisition
system. The data acquisition system is connected to the vehicle via the
diagnostics port.

The pulse steer test consists of driving straight ahead at constant speed,
'pulsing' the steering wheel by rapidly steering to a non-zero steer angle and
returning the steering to centre.

The pulse steer test is performed on a flat testing area of a race track. This
test is performed off the active track and in a designated testing area.

A test speed of 30 km/h is chosen for safety purposes. The duration of a pulse
steer test is very short; a single test is less than 2 seconds in duration.

The test is performed immediately after leaving the active track such that the
tire temperatures and tire pressures are similar to those seen in racing
conditions.

_Safety is of utmost concern. At no time did the vehicle operate outside the
scope of driver control, and at no time  did the driver operate the vehicle in
an unsafe manner. Do not perform this test in an uncontrolled area._

# Vehicle Parameters

The following vehicle parameters are assumed for the vehicle-under-test:

| Symbol | Value | Unit             | Description                       |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| $$a$$  | 0.996 | m                | Distance from CG to front axle    |
| $$b$$  | 1.624 | m                | Distance from CG to rear axle     |
| $$m$$  | 1450  | kg               | Vehicle mass                      |
| $$I$$  | 2345  | kg m<sup>2</sup> | Vehicle yaw inertia               |
| $$K$$  | 5.5   | deg/g            | Understeer gradient (as measured) |

# Results

The system identification yields the following cornering compliances:

* $$D_f = 9.6$$ [deg/g]
* $$D_r = 4.1$$ [deg/g]

The difference between the front and rear cornering compliances yields the
understeer gradient:

$$K = D_f - D_r = 5.5\ [deg/g]$$

The following graph shows the simulated response plotted against the
experimental data acquired from in-vehicle testing.

![pulsesteer_ddt](/assets/images/2019-01-06/pulsesteer_test_ddt.png)

The simulation over-predicts the yaw acceleration of the vehicle in comparison
to the experimental data. However, the model matches the peak yaw rate of the
experimental data quite well. Peak lateral acceleration is under-predicted in
the positive case, but correlates well in the negative case.

To validate the model, on-track data from another session is compared against
the simulation. The chosen validation dataset is of a warmup lap at Toronto
Motorsports Park, turns 7 & 8. The vehicle speed is near constant at
approximately 80 km/h.

![pulsesteer_tmp](/assets/images/2019-01-06/pulsesteer_test_tmp.png)

The simulation under-predicts the peak lateral acceleration by approximately
20% in both directions. Yaw rate is well predicted in the negative case, but is
under-predicted in the positive case.

# Summary

The purpose of performing the pulse steer test is to identify the front and
rear cornering compliances of the vehicle. Combined with the understeer
gradient test, a simple transient vehicle model is developed.

Simulation and modelling enables analytical insight into vehicle handling. The
simulation is not without caveats; the simulation does not perfectly capture 
the transient response of the vehicle observed the experimental data. Despite
these pitfalls in the accuracy of the simulation, the model has enough fidelity
to provide useful information about the vehicle. The ability to generalize the
vehicle response in a simulation is still an extremely powerful tool in analyzing
and assessing handling performance.

_A big thank you to OTA competitor Joseph Yang in the #551 2012 Honda Civic Si
for performing the pulse steer test and for providing the data used the
analysis. This article would not be possible without the support of Joseph Yang
and his sponsors._
