This year's racing season was marked by a shift in focus from the vehicle to
the racing driver. Vehicle development was not sufficient to achieve the
desired performance objectives. We had to look elsewhere for performance
improvements; this is when driver development came into focus.

Vehicle engineering benefits from of a history of research. Notable discoveries
in vehicle dynamics were studied as early as the 1930s with pioneers like
Maurice Olley. In contrast, the case to study motor racing as a sport was
proposed in 2013 by Potkanowicz and Mondel. Searching on Google Scholar for
'vehicle dynamics' shows 195,000 results; the term 'driver science' yields 228
results.

To study the driver in equal weight and importance to studying the vehicle
would mean understanding the current state-of-the-art. This is when we relied
on David Ferguson's book, "The Science of Motorsport".

## Motivation
As a enthusiast at the amateur levels of motorsport, I wanted to know the
following:
* Why do professional racing drivers have superior vehicle maneuvering abilities?
* What are the constitutive skills and traits of a good racing driver?
* How can I help drivers achieve their performance objectives?

These questions are motivated by the quantity of anecdotal findings. The
quality of these findings varies and corroboration with literature is necessary
to verify their validity. While seat time is important, it is not sufficient;
further development is required to achieve success within the constraints of
the sport.

The increased visibility of driver development programs at the professional
level contributes to this line of questioning. Professional driver development
programs like the McLaren Human Performance Program are quite secretive, though
their existence is suggestive their value.

## The Book
David P. Ferguson's "The Science of Motorsport" is one of the few books that
addresses the importance of human performance using evidence-based research to
support their findings. Its editor describes it as an 'accessible and
up-to-date resource'. I will agree with the latter, with the book representing
a snapshot in what is known about human performance in motorsport.

The book is a 165 page paperback covering a wide range of topics from
physiological demands, nutritional requirements, psychological considerations to
track safety. Each chapter is written by a subject expert contributor and is
supported by numerous external citations.

Each chapter is sufficiently structured to be read independently. However, they
are ordered intentionally to build upon the idea of the driver-athlete to make
the same case for team success and track safety. Human performance is not
limited to just the racing driver, but to pit crews and safety teams working
along side the racing driver.

"The Science of Motorsport" is not without caveats; there is no _recipe_ for
improving your driving skill and it lacks actionable tools described in many
self-help driving resources. The reader is left to themselves to develop a
program that best suites their performance objectives with the field being too
young to have concrete recommendations. Arguably, this is an accurate
reflection of the state-of-the art with many questions left for professionals,
academics and amateurs alike.

## What We Learned
The application of sports science and sports psychology presents a compelling
new opportunity for improving performance and safety. By applying the
lessons-learned from other competitive sports in a task-specific manner, we can
train the racing driver in a more deliberate and targeted fashion that will
enhance their driving capabilities.

# Driver-Athlete
Anyone with a valid drivers license can drive a vehicle; however, the racing
driver is an athlete who is subjected to wide variety of physical stressors. By
operating a racing vehicle, the racing driver is subjected to high
temperatures, carbon monoxide exposure, vehicle vibrations, and inertial
forces.

This puts the racing driver under extreme physiological stress. In studies
involving endurance racing drivers, it is shown that heart rate values reach
\>80% of age-estimated maximal heart rates. Physical strength is required to
operate the vehicle controls under continuous g-force loading cycles.
Additionally, the driver must operate in these conditions for the duration of
their stint which can last towards 2 hours in certain endurance series.

# Measuring Driver Demand
The pervasive use of data acquisition systems demonstrates its importance in
performance engineering. With the rise of CAN and OBD-II enabled systems, the
data acquisition system has become an indispensable tool for professionals and
amateurs alike.

Interestingly, the same pervasiveness has not yet extended to the racing driver
both on and off the race track. Both subjective and objective measurements can
provide insight into human performance. Off the race track, conventional
metrics can be used to assess physical fitness. These metrics include VO2max,
lactate threshold, strength tests results and physiological measures.

# Mental Skills
High-speed vehicle maneuvering is a cognitively demanding task that requires a
high degree of concentration. The racing driver must process information in
real-time and make decisions based on these observations. Concentration is the
underlying mechanism that enables the racing driver to perform, but requires
training to focus on task-relevant information in the presence of distractions.

Mental skills have been successfully applied to competitive sports. Goal
setting and motivation are critical in long-term development and growth.
Arousal regulation before a session can affect the driver's focus and
physiologic state, which in turn can affect performance.

## Future Research
Determining how to apply the strategies in sports science is the kernel to
realizing its value on the race track. Based on the current research and
state-of-the-art, these are lines of investigation that could benefit all
levels of motorsport.

# Driver-specific Training
The driver-athlete is unique in that they are conditioned to cope with
task-specific stressors. Because of the unique demands in motorsports, training
needs to be task-specific in order to take advantage of the principle of
specificity.

Driving specific training would involve developing a fitness routine that
exercises the body under the same conditions as in the race car cockpit.
Understanding the muscular and physiological demands that the driver
experiences can be used to derive training requirements. Determining the
task-specific exercises which are maximally transferable to high-speed vehicle
maneuvering is primary challenge in improving fitness variables and performance
outcomes.

# Perceptual Training
A differentiating factor between experts and non-experts is their ability to
process sports specific information. Unlike an aircraft pilot who relies on
flight instruments over their senses, the racing driver must integrate
perceptual information to plan and control the racing vehicle.

Improving the ability to perceive task-relevant information can be trained
outside of the vehicle. Vestibular exercises are primarily used for concussion
therapy. Can they be applied after periods of increased physiological demand to
improve balance and coordination? Racing simulators can be used to emulate the
visual and audio stimuli of high-speed vehicle maneuvering. The availability of
high quality simulation programs means they can be integrated into a
task-specific training program.

# Optimal Control
With the rise of autonomous vehicles, can the same technology be used to bring
insight into high-speed vehicle maneuvering?

Optimal control problems would yield a solution to the high-speed vehicle
maneuvering problem without consideration of human factors. Autonomous vehicle
control stacks are built on a control hierarchy similar to the
perceptual-cognitive models presented for humans (ie. perception, localization,
planning, control).  These solutions benefit from an understood mathematical
basis which could be transferred to human drivers to rapidly achieve maximum
performance.

## Conclusion
The complexity of high-speed vehicle maneuvering demands maximum performance
from  both the race car and racing driver. Understanding the necessary
conditions for success forms the basis of an integrated and comprehensive
driver development program.

There is no avoiding human factors in this sport regardless of if you are an
amateur or a professional. Vehicle performance and track safety are dependent
on the ability for humans to perform at their best. Driver science is an
exciting new field of research that can help make the sport safer and more
enjoyable for everyone.

"The Science of Motorsport" succeeds in bringing evidence-based research to the
racing driver problem. Combined with existing literature in high-speed vehicle
maneuvering, it presents enormous value by providing meaningful context into
the sport; a must read for anyone who is serious about improving themselves as
a racing driver.
