The tire contact patch is a critical area of study in vehicle dynamics. The
forces generated at the contact patch are responsible for the vehicle's
handling and control properties. This phenomenon underpins the foundations of
vehicle dynamics.

The tire contact patch can be visualized using empirical measurement
techniques. The simplest method is to take an ink block print where the
resultant tire footprint can then be analyzed.

In this study, we will look at the static contact patch shape of a used
Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R 255/40R17 98W tire using ink blocking techniques.
The contact patch shape evolution under the influence of inflation pressure,
inclination angle and vertical load is explored.

## Tire footprints

Contact patch visualization allows for its length, width and contact area to be
analyzed. A simple visualization technique is to take an block print. This
involves making an impression of the tire over a flat surface, much like
pressing a rubber stamp against a medium to create an impression. The industry
standard [ASTM F870][1] defines the steps to perform this visualization using
ink. Although contact patch visualization is primarily used for tire research,
we can apply the same concepts from literature to observe trends in the
ultra-high performance tire segment.

The ink block prints are obtained using a static tire testing fixture. Designed
and built by [_Formula Delta_][2], the tire testing fixture allows ink block
prints to be taken under controlled inflation pressure, inclination angle and
vertical load. The capabilities of the test fixture is shown in the table
below.

| Parameter                   | Value   |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| **Vertical load, max** [N]  | -6675   |
| **Loaded radius, max** [mm] | 375     |
| **Tire width, max** [mm]    | 400     |
| **Inclination angle** [deg] | 0, 2, 4 |
| **Bolt pattern**            | 5x114   |

Long-time followers may be familiar with this technique from [Choosing Tire
Pressure using Static Contact Patch Measurements][3]. In this iteration, the
study makes use of the test fixture to add inclination angle and vertical load
as inputs to the study.

## Test schedule

The tire under test is a used Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R 255/40R17 98W with a
date of manufacture of September 2018. The measured tread depth is 4.5 mm.
Ambient temperature is measured at 17 Â°C. The tire is mounted on a 9 inch wide
rim.

The test matrix consists of five inflation pressures, three inclination angles
and five vertical loads. The test conditions are summarized in the table below.

| Test condition               | Value                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Inflation pressure** [PSI] | 24, 27, 30, 33, 36              |
| **Inclination angle** [deg]  | 0, 2, 4                         |
| **Vertical load** [lbs]      | -500, -800, -1000, -1200, -1400 |

A wide range of inflation pressures are selected to reflect the needs of
different cars. A set of footprints are presented to demonstrate the influence
of inflation pressure.

The choice of inclination angle is fixed given the capabilities of the test
fixture. You can see the effect of inclination angle in the footprints shown
below.

![inclination angle sweep](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-inclination-angle-sweep.png)

To focus the study in the most interesting operating regions of the tire, we
choose a set of vertical loads near the maximum testing limit. Vertical loads
from -1400 lbs to -800 lbs are tested in 200 lb increments. An additional
condition of -500 lbs is added to capture the contact patch phenomenon when the
tire is unloaded.

![vertical load sweep](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-vertical-load-sweep.png)

In total, 75 unique ink block prints were obtained for this study.

## Analysis

The ink block prints are analyzed using a computer. The footprints are
digitized and filtered before being passed through an analysis routine. The
measurements extracted from the analysis include the contact patch length,
width and area.

### Geometry

The simplest property that can be measured from the tire footprint is its
geometry. We can gain some insight simply by looking at the contact patch
length and width.

![geometry analysis](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-geometry-analysis.png)

An interesting trend that emerges is the effect of inclination angle on width.
At high loads, the contact patch width decreases with inclination angle. At an
inclination angle for 4 deg and a vertical load of -500 lbs, the contact patch
is lengthened but the width is shortened. This is because the full width of the
tire no longer engaged with the road surface.

### Contact area

In this study, the gross contact area is the area of a convex hull that
encircles the tire footprint. Within this convex hull, the area that is not in
contact with the road is the void area. The void ratio can be computed as the
ratio between the void area and the gross contact area.

![gross area analysis](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-gross-area-analysis.png)

The trend with inflation pressure is similar across inclination angles. The
gross contact area trends down as the inclination angle is increased though the
effect is subtle in these graphs. This is most pronounced at 4 deg of
inclination angle.

The void ratio charts are a mess, though it does suggest that the tire tread
pattern is designed to achieve a desired range of void ratios. The void ratio
can vary from 0.26 to 0.37 with a mean of 0.31 across all conditions.

### Aspect ratio

In this analysis, the contact patch aspect ratio is defined as the ratio
between the contact patch length and width. This characterizes the shape of the
contact patch. A 1:1 aspect ratio indicates a _square_ contact patch shape in
the sense that the width is equal to its length.

![aspect ratio analysis](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-aspect-ratio-analysis.png)

The most interesting finding is how the aspect ratio is changing at 4 degrees
of inclination angle. The effect of the tire lifting off the ground can be
observed at 4 deg inclination angle and -500 lbs of vertical load, just as we
observed in the footprint geometry.

## Load sensitivity

Tire are known to be load sensitive. This phenomenon can be explored in the
context of contact patch shape and size. The heat map below shows the load
sensitivity of the contact patch length, width and gross area, averaged by
inflation pressure.

![load sensitivity analysis](/assets/images/2021-09-25/bridgstone-re71r-255-40-R17-load-sensitivity-analysis.png)

Of the three sensitivities presented, the contact patch width has the clearest
trend where the change per 100 lbs of vertical load is reduced as the load is
increased. This is more pronounced as inclination angle is increased. Load
sensitivity is less clear in the contact patch length and gross area, though it
can be argued that some distinction can be made between high loads and low
loads.

## Final comments

The relationship between the tire contact patch shape versus inflation
pressure, inclination angle and vertical load is complex. In the case of the
Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R 255/40R17 98W, the contact patch becomes distorted
at high inclination angles as the full width of the tire is no longer in
contact with the ground. Inflation pressure tends to decrease the gross contact
area and is more pronounced at high vertical loads. A load sensitivity effect
is observed in the contact patch shape.

Tires are sophisticated engineered products designed to handle the extreme
conditions demanded by modern road vehicles. The tire contact patch is the
vehicle's interface with the ground and is responsible for generating forces
that affect handling and control. Gaining insight into this phenomenon
represents an advantage in chassis design and setup. Static laboratory tests
provide unique insight that subjective on-track testing alone cannot. As lab
tests are controlled and repeatable, it is a unique way to compare tires before
the rubber meets the road.
