This year's racing season was marked by a shift in focus from the vehicle to
the racing driver. Vehicle development was not sufficient to achieve the
desired performance objectives. We had to look elsewhere for performance
improvements and found opportunities in driver development.

Vehicle engineering benefits from of a history of research. Notable discoveries
in vehicle dynamics were studied as early as the 1930s with pioneers like
Maurice Olley. In contrast, the case to study racing driving as a sport was
proposed in 2013 by Potkanowicz and Mondel. Searching on Google Scholar for
'vehicle dynamics' shows 195,000 results; the term 'driver science' yields 228
results.

To study the driver in equal weight and importance to studying the vehicle
would mean understanding the current state-of-the-art. This is when we relied
on David Ferguson's book, "The Science of Motorsport".

# Motivation
As a enthusiast at the amateur levels of motorsport, I wanted to know the
following:
* Why do professional racing drivers have superior vehicle maneuvering abilities?
* What are the constitutive skills and traits that make a good racing driver?
* How can I help drivers achieve their performance objectives?

These questions are motivated by the quantity of anecdotal findings.  The
quality of these findings varies and corroboration with literature is necessary
to verify their validity. While seat time is important, it is not sufficient;
further development is required to achieve success.

The increased visibility of driver development programs at the professional
level contributes to this line of questioning. Professional driver development
programs like the McLaren Human Performance Program are quite secretive, though
their existence is suggestive their value.

# The Book
David P. Ferguson's "The Science of Motorsport" is one of the few books that
addresses the importance of human performance using evidence-based research to
support their findings. Its editor describes it as an 'accessible and
up-to-date resource'. I will agree with the latter, with the book representing
a snapshot in what is known about human performance in motorsport.

The book is a 165 page paperback covering a wide range of topics from
physiological demands, nutritional requirements, psychological considerations to
track safety. Each chapter is written by a subject expert contributor and is
supported by numerous external citations.

Each chapter is sufficiently structured to be read independently. However, it
is clear they ordered to thematically develop from discussing the acute
stressors placed on the driver to the importance of teamwork on overall
success. Human performance is not limited to just the racing driver, but to pit
crews and safety teams working along side the racing driver.

"The Science of Motorsport" is not without caveats; there is no _recipe_ for
improving your driving skill and it lacks actionable tools described in many
self-help driving resources. The reader is left to themselves to develop a
program that best suites their performance objectives with the field being too
young to have concrete recommendations. However, this is an accurate reflection
of the state-of-the art with many questions left for professionals, academics
and amateurs alike.

# What We Learned
Despite the wealth of literature available in sports science and sports
psychology, it is apparent that its application to motorsports represents a new
opportunity for improving vehicle performance and track safety.

## Driver-Athlete
Although anyone with a valid drivers license can drive a vehicle, the racing
driver is an athlete who is subjected to wide variety of physical stressors. By
operating a racing vehicle, the racing driver is subjected to high
temperatures, carbon monoxide exposure, vehicle vibrations, and inertial
forces.

This puts the racing driver under extreme physiological stress. In studies
involving endurance racing drivers, it is shown that heart rate values reach
\>80% of age-estimated maximal heart rates. Physical strength is required to
operate the vehicle controls under continuous g-loading cycles. Additionally,
the driver must operate in these conditions for the duration of their stint,
sometimes lasting up to 2 hours.

## Measuring Driver Demand
The pervasive use of data acquisition systems demonstrates its importance in
performance engineering. With the rise of CAN and OBD-II enabled systems, the
data acquisition system has become an indispensable tool for professionals and
amateurs alike.

Interestingly, the same pervasiveness has not yet extended to the racing
driver, both on and off the race track. Both subjective and objective
measurements can provide insight into human performance. Off the race track,
conventional metrics can be used to assess physical fitness. These metrics
include VO2max, lactate threshold, strength tests results and physiological
measures.

## Mental Skills
High-speed vehicle maneuvering is a cognitively demanding task that requires a
high degree of concentration. The racing driver must process information in
real-time and make decisions based on these observations. Concentration is the
underlying mechanism that enables the racing driver to perform, but requires
training to focus on task-relevant information in the presence of distractions.

Mental skills have been successfully applied to competitive sports. Goal
setting and motivation are key strategies in long-term development and growth.
Arousal regulation before a session can affect driver focus and can have
negative physiological and therefore performance effects.

# Future Research
## Driver Specific Development
The driver-athlete is unique in that they are conditioned to cope with
task-specific stressors. Because of the unique demands in motorsports, training
needs to be task-specific in order to take advantage of the principle of
specificity.

Driving specific training involves developing a fitness routine that work the
muscle groups involved in high-speed vehicle maneuvering under the same
conditions as in the race car cockpit. Understanding the muscular and
physiological demands that the driver experiences can be used to derive
training requirements. Determining the task-specific exercises which are
maximally transferable to high-speed vehicle maneuvering is the core to
improving fitness variables and performance outcomes.

## Perceptual Training
A differentiating factor between experts and non-experts is their ability to
process sports specific information. Unlike an aircraft pilot who relies on
flight instruments, the racing driver must integrate perceptual information to
plan and control the racing vehicle.

Improving the ability to perceive task-relevant information can be trained
outside of the vehicle. Vestibular exercises are primarily used for concussion
therapy, though can they be applied after periods of increased physiological
demand to improve balance and coordination? Racing simulators can be used to
emulate the visual stimuli of high-speed vehicle maneuvering, and can be
integrated into a training routine to emulate conditions in the cockpit.

## Optimal Control
With the rise of autonomous vehicles, can the same technology be used to bring
insight into high-speed vehicle maneuvering?

Optimal control problems would yield a solution to the high-speed vehicle
maneuvering problem without consideration of human factors. Typical autonomous
vehicle control stacks rely on a hierarchy similar to the perceptual-cognitive
models presented for humans (ie. perception, localization, planning, control).
These solutions benefit from an understood mathematical basis which could be
transferred to human drivers to rapidly achieve maximum performance.
